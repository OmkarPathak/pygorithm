Sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the efficient algorithms to find all the prime numbers up to n, where n can be
up to 10 million. This algorithm is very efficient and fast and hence is preferred by many competitive programmers.

Algorithm:
1. Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 to n: (2, 3, 4, â€¦, n).
2. Initially, let p equal 2, the first prime number.
3. Starting from p, count up in increments of p and mark each of these numbers greater than p itself in the list.
   These numbers will be 2p, 3p, 4p, etc.; note that some of them may have already been marked.
4. Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise,
   let p now equal this number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
When the algorithm terminates, all the numbers in the list that are not marked (i.e are True) are prime.
