    Imagine you have a bunch of balls, each with a different number on it. To sort the balls, you first throw them up in the air. As each ball falls back down, it follows a unique path based on its number.

    As the balls fall back down and land, they come to rest at a location in 2D space.

    To sort the balls based on their 2D coordinates, you can imagine lining up the balls along a winding road (Hilbert curve) based on their location. The balls that are close together along the road are also close together in 2D space.

    Finally, you can read off the sorted order of the balls by simply following the order in which they appear along the winding road. This is similar to reading a book by following the order of the words on the page.

    In this analogy the balls would start in 1D space and be transposed into 2D space, the 3rd dimension is mostly analogy.
